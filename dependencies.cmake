# A list of specific version for the dependencies of this build.
#
# The contents here will aid in 'pinning' the contents of the build. Changing this file constitutes changing the build
# and this means that the integration version should be promoted. The version numbers (tags) specified here will be
# injected into the CMakeLists.txt file in the External_project_add definitions and will, therefore, control the
# versions of various sub libs built and integrated. They need not be official versions and can be arbitrary branches or
# tags such as dev feature branches etc.
#
# You can affect the build content by manipulating the "tag/branch" column. Should be something that git expects for that 
# repo.
